Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.66,0:01:41.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I was thinking, if somebody like me who wanted to apply but who noticed the deadline had passed,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.20,0:01:45.00,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: if they applied anyway, I wanted to know what would happen

Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.15,0:01:54.60,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: Yeah, so I sent them a DM to let them know
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.60,0:02:00.13,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: And then, they replied with something like, "Thank you very much."

Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.73,0:02:35.33,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Ah, so they were like, "Wow this person's rank is crazy high."
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.33,0:02:40.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: Yeah, so they probably thought I was a girl who was good at games or something
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.20,0:02:44.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: They were looking for girls who were good at games who liked gaming,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.20,0:02:47.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: so I think that's why they extended an offer to me
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.20,0:02:53.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: So, the interviews went like 1, 2, 3, and I ended up getting in
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.20,0:02:56.13,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Isn't that amazing? Are you some kind of light novel protagonist?

Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.00,0:03:01.60,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: The fact you were accepted like that is insane
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.60,0:03:03.66,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I actually didn't think that I'd be accepted
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.66,0:03:06.33,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: So you were just like, "How about I give this a shot"?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.33,0:03:07.93,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I was going at it very lightheartedly
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.93,0:03:13.13,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I was like, "Since it sounds like a good opportunity, why not?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.13,0:03:16.33,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: And, you know, for the audition, you have to send a short video, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.33,0:03:22.66,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: And, I sent a shitty, effortless 30 second clip that only had audio
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.66,0:03:24.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: What's with that? ww
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.00,0:03:27.25,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: So it wasn't a video that you put effort in to produce?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.25,0:03:29.65,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: No, it wasn't! It only had my voice, like,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.60,0:03:34.20,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I was like, 'blah blah blah'
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.20,0:03:39.80,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: So, after going on like that for a while, at the very end, I said something like
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.80,0:03:45.46,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: "I'm confident that, out of all the Vspo girls, I am the best at games."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.46,0:03:47.40,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I said something like that www
Dialogue: 0,0:03:47.40,0:03:49.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: You're fucked up! ww
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.40,0:03:54.73,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: But, that's reassuring from the staff's perspective right? They'd be likie, "Wow, this one's something."
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.73,0:03:59.33,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: No, but, to be able to say something like that, you were one hell of a omwan
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.33,0:04:03.93,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: Yeah, I think it was that craziness that got me in
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.93,0:04:06.46,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Well, for streamers, craziness is really important
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.46,0:04:09.26,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: So there was no mistake on the part of Vspo's staff
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.26,0:04:12.66,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: That could have ended up differently ww
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.26,0:04:12.66,Translator,,0,0,0,,TLN: 躱してる can also mean 'to evade/dodge (something).'
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.66,0:04:14.40,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: I'm glad ww
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.40,0:04:18.00,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: But, it's important to leave as big an impression as you can, right? Whatever the occasion.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.00,0:04:19.20,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: I see
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.20,0:04:22.06,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: The reason why you chose your agency is really interesting
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.06,0:04:23.86,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: It's pretty amazing, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.86,0:04:27.93,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Yeah, it's pretty rare
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.93,0:04:31.73,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Alright, well, the talk of how your audition went was quite shocking in itself, but
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.73,0:04:33.73,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: let's continue with this next question
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.73,0:04:39.40,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: "What were the streams or collaborations that were turning points for Hinano-san's career?"
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.40,0:04:43.23,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: Well, there's also the case where Hinano became known after getting banned, but
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.23,0:04:46.03,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: I think each streamer has their own causes of popularity
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.03,0:04:48.93,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,T: do you remember around when these events happened for you?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.93,0:04:54.00,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: Let' see, the first.. well, there were two.

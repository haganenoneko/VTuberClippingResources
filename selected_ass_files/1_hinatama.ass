Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.43,0:04:42.86,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: That's right. It was an otaku whose name showed their real face (?)
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.43,0:04:42.86,Translator,,0,0,0,,TLN: I'm not familiar with YouTube, but I guess she's referring to their profile picture? I don't see why that would be a problem...

Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.03,0:05:26.35,Hinano,,0,0,0,,H: My ideal tsundere is Suzumiya Haruhi

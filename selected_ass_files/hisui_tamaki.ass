Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.05,0:03:35.70,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,That is, you were somebody who didn't care for ships besides Tenma-kun x Kyosuke-kun
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.70,0:03:40.60,Translator,,0,0,0,,TLN: uuuh.... I think it's pretty clear what is meant here. Recall the old adage, "one for using, one for reading."

Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.40,0:04:41.95,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So there aren't a lot of people who could have been there
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.95,0:04:45.75,Tamaki,,0,0,0,, In the first place.. that's too scary to think about..
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.75,0:04:49.60,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So that's how the two of us became connected
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.70,0:04:55.50,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Wait, it's starting to be fun talking about Inazuma 11, could we stop?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.50,0:05:01.85,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,So it was then that you knew about Norio-mama, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.85,0:05:05.85,Hisui,,0,0,0,,Honestly, what made me put two and two together was Gundou-sensei's tweet
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.85,0:05:08.60,Tamaki,,0,0,0,,Ah, so, before that, you had no idea?
